Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them

1.Responsive Layout: Initially, some sections were misaligned on different screen sizes. I used Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and media queries to ensure consistency.

2.Optimization for Performance: Large image files slowed down the page. I optimized images using compression techniques and lazy loading.

3.Cross-Browser Compatibility: Some CSS properties didn't render properly in all browsers. I tested across different browsers and adjusted styles accordingly.
